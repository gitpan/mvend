<B>MiniVend Tech Tip</B>
<P>
MiniVend has been tested on <I>Linux</I>, <I>FreeBSD</I>, <I>Irix 5</I>,
<I>OSF/1</I>, <I>Solaris 2</I>, <I>OSF/1</I>, 
<I>SunOS</I> that I know of. If you successfully install
and run it on another operating system, please <A
HREF="mailto:bugs@bill.iac.net">let me know</A>. The base server
should be very portable -- the <I>vlink.c</I> program is the
weakest link of the chain so far, and it is much improved
for MiniVend 1.03. If you had
any problems with the program, please let me know that too. The
goal is to make MiniVend run on any UNIX with Perl 5.
